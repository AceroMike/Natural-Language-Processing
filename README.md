Natural Language Processing Practice


In this repo you will find practice that I have done while learning Natural Language Processing. Many topics will be covered in different Jupyter Notebooks as well as simple to follow examples. You will find worked examples with real and made up data on many different Natural Language Processing topics, tools, and methods. Examples will include modeling with **N-grams**, **TF-IDF**, as well as **Word2Vec**. Many of the examples use data from **Natural Language Toolkit's (nltk)** corpus **gutenberg**. The gutenberg corpus has the text for 18 different books. I choose 2 documents/books to work with from the corpus: Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll and Persuasion by Jane Austen. After cleaning and preparing the text data, I apply the aforementioned techniques to feature engineer and model. The goal of the models is to see if I can classify the sentences from the books as being written by a certain author. I use three different Classification Machine Learning Models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **Gradient Boosting Classifier**. By comparing the results of the models I am better able to understand the impact that the features, and changing parameters, have on model performance. 

Stay tuned as I add more!
